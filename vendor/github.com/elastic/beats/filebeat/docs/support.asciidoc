=== Known Issues
==== Network Volumes

We do not recommend reading log files from network volumes. Whenever possible, install Filebeat on the host machine and
send the log files directly from there. Reading files from network volumes (especially on Windows) can have unexpected side effects. For example, changed file identifiers
may result in Filebeat reading a log file from scratch again.
